And he wasn't about to take credit for God's work. That's the transformation - from fearful to fearless, but also from self-focused to God-focused.",

Weak, scared, constantly doubting. But he kept saying yes to God even when he was terrified. And God turned a coward into a warrior.

But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, 'Lord, save me.'

Yeah, he started sinking when he looked at the waves. But for a moment - HE WALKED ON WATER. The only human besides Jesus to ever do that.",
            "This is Peter's whole vibe. He's impulsive, bold, quick to act. Sometimes it gets him in trouble. Sometimes it's exactly what's needed. Jesus didn't rebuke him for getting out of the boat. He just asked, 'Why did you doubt?' Because doubt is what makes you sink, not the waves.",

You're gonna fail sometimes when you step out in faith. But you'll never walk on water if you stay in the boat. Peter teaches us: bold faith beats careful doubt every time."

And if you're honest, you've been there too. You've denied Jesus. Maybe not out loud, but in your actions. When it was easier to stay quiet than stand up. When peer pressure won.

            "Here's why this matters: Your failures don't define you. Peter's worst moment wasn't his final moment. Jesus met him where he was - fishing, probably depressed, feeling like a failure - and reminded him of his purpose.
