                scripture: "1 SAMUEL 16:6-7 (ESV)",
                verses: "When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, 'Surely the Lord's anointed is before him.' But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look on his appearance... For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.'",
                reflection: "Your dad has seven sons. A prophet shows up looking for the next king. Your dad brings out son #1. Nope. Goes through ALL SEVEN older brothers. Then asks, 'Is this everybody?' Dad says, 'Oh yeah, there's David... but he's just out with the sheep.' Not even worth bringing in.<br><br>David wasn't picked because he was strongest or most popular. God says: 'Man looks at the outside. I look at the heart.' Your followers don't matter. Your max bench press doesn't matter. What matters is who you are when nobody's watching.",

                scripture: "1 SAMUEL 17:45-47 (ESV)",
                verses: "Then David said to the Philistine, 'You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts... that all this assembly may know that the Lord saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the Lord's.'",
                reflection: "Goliath is 9 feet tall. Covered in armor. Professional warrior. Entire army is terrified. David is a teenager with a slingshot. Everyone thinks he's insane. But David says something wild: 'The battle is the Lord's.' He's not relying on his own strength. He knows God is bigger than any giant.<br><br>Your giants might not be 9 feet tall. But they're real. Fear. Doubt. Addiction. Anxiety. Whatever it is, you can't beat it alone. But here's the truth: God specializes in giant-sized problems. When you face something impossible, that's when He shows up.",

                    "Everyone told David he was crazy. When have people doubted you for trusting God?",

                scripture: "1 SAMUEL 17:40, 48-50 (ESV)",
                verses: "Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd's pouch... David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.",
                reflection: "David picked FIVE stones. Not one. Five. Why? Maybe he knew Goliath had four brothers. Maybe he wanted backup. Point is: David prepared. He didn't just walk out there with faith and hope it worked out. He picked the right stones. Practiced his aim. Combined faith with preparation.<br><br>Faith isn't reckless. It's not 'close your eyes and hope.' It's 'I'm gonna do everything I can, and trust God with the rest.' You study for the test AND pray. You train hard AND ask God for strength. David's five stones teach us: faith + preparation = giant-slaying power.",

                    "David was prepared from years of killing lions and bears. How is God preparing you right now for something bigger?",

'Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands.' And Saul was very angry... And Saul eyed David from that day on.",
                reflection: "David kills Goliath. Becomes a hero overnight. Songs are written about him. Everyone loves him. And King Saul? Jealous. Threatened. Starts trying to kill David. Success brings new problems. Fame attracts haters. When you win, some people won't celebrate—they'll resent you.<br><br>This is where most people crash. They taste success and either get prideful or get destroyed by jealousy from others. David had to navigate both. Stay humble when everyone's praising you. Stay strong when powerful people are against you. That's the real test—not killing the giant, but handling what comes after.",
                questions: [
                    "When's the last time you succeeded at something? How did people react?",
                    "David stayed humble despite fame. How do you stay grounded when things go well?",
                    "Saul's jealousy nearly destroyed David. How do you handle it when people resent your success?",

                reflection: "David wrote this. The same guy who killed a giant. The same guy who was hunted by a king. The same guy who messed up big time later in life. Through it all, David kept coming back to this truth: God is his stronghold. When you're that secure in who God is, fear loses its power.<br><br>Giant killer mindset isn't about being the strongest or smartest. It's about knowing WHO you're fighting for and WHO'S fighting for you. You're not facing life alone. God's got you. That's not motivational talk—that's reality. When you really believe it, you become dangerous to every giant in your path.",

                reflection: "Imagine being hated by your own brothers. Not disliked—HATED. Joseph's dad picked favorites. Joseph got special treatment. His brothers got jealousy and rage. Then Joseph tells them about his dreams where THEY bow to HIM. Even if it's from God, that's not gonna land well.<br><br>Sometimes you get put in terrible situations through no fault of your own. Your parents might favor a sibling. People might hate you for advantages you didn't ask for. Joseph couldn't make his brothers love him. All he could do was keep being faithful to God. The hard truth: You can't always fix it. But God is still with you.",
