        scriptureRef: "1 Samuel 16:6-13 (ESV)",
        scripture: [
            "When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, \"Surely the Lord's anointed is before him.\" But the Lord said to Samuel, \"Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.\"",
            "Then Jesse called seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, \"The Lord has not chosen these.\" Then Samuel said to Jesse, \"Are all your sons here?\" And he said, \"There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep.\" And Samuel said to Jesse, \"Send and get him.\"",
            "Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the Lord said, \"Arise, anoint him, for this is he.\" Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward."

        reflection: [
            "Your dad has seven sons. A prophet shows up looking for the next king. Your dad brings out son #1. Nope. Son #2. Nope. Goes through ALL SEVEN older brothers. Then the prophet asks, \"Bro, is this everybody?\" Dad's like, \"Oh yeah, there's David... but he's just out with the sheep.\" JUST OUT WITH THE SHEEP. Not even worth bringing in.",
            "That's cold. David was the forgotten kid doing dirty work nobody else wanted. While brothers trained for war, David was alone in fields watching animals. But God looked at all seven impressive brothers and said nah. Then saw David—youngest, overlooked, the shepherd—and said THAT'S MY GUY.",
            "David wasn't picked because he was strongest, tallest, or most popular. God says: \"Man looks at the outside. I look at the heart.\" Translation: Your social media followers don't matter. Your workout stats don't matter. Whether you got picked first or last doesn't matter. What matters is who you are when nobody's watching."

            "If God said \"I look at the heart\" and looked at yours right now, what would He see?",

        context: "Context: Israel is at war with the Philistines. There's this giant named Goliath—9 feet tall, covered in armor—and he's been trash-talking Israel for 40 days straight. The entire army is terrified. Then David shows up.",
        scriptureRef: "1 Samuel 17:32-37 (ESV)",
        scripture: [
            "And David said to Saul, \"Let no man's heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\" And Saul said to David, \"You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.\"",
            "But David said to Saul, \"Your servant used to keep sheep for his father. And when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock, I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth. And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him. Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.\"",
            "And David said, \"The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\""
        ],
        reflection: [
            "Picture this: There's a 9-FOOT-TALL dude in full armor yelling insults at your whole country for over a month. Every soldier in the army—trained warriors—is too scared to fight him. And then this teenager walks up and says, \"I got this.\"",
            "King Saul's like, \"Kid, you can't fight him. You're just a kid and he's been doing this since he was YOUR age.\" Basically: You're not qualified. You don't have the experience. You're too young. Sound familiar? That's what everyone says when you want to do something big.",
            "But check out David's response. He doesn't back down. He's like, \"Bro, I killed a LION and a BEAR when they tried to take my sheep. Grabbed them by the beard and took them out. This dude is just another animal that's messing with God's people.\" That's some cold confidence right there. And here's the key: David's confidence wasn't in himself. It was in God. \"The Lord who delivered me from the lion will deliver me from this dude.\"",
            "Here's what gets me: David had been preparing for this moment his whole life and didn't even know it. All those lonely nights protecting sheep? That was his training ground. The lions and bears? That's where he learned to trust God in life-or-death situations. When the giant moment came, he was ready—not because he was big and strong, but because he'd already seen God come through."

        questions: [
            "What's your \"Goliath\" right now—that huge thing that feels impossible to face?",
            "Think about the \"lions and bears\" in your life—smaller battles you've already won. What did you learn?",
            "When David said \"God delivered me before, He'll deliver me again,\" he had proof. What's your proof that God's got you?",
            "If you knew 100% that God had your back, what would you actually do this week?"

        context: "Context: David's about to fight Goliath. King Saul tries to dress him up in armor, but David's like nah. He grabs his sling and five stones from a stream. Then he walks toward a giant with basically zero protection.",
        scriptureRef: "1 Samuel 17:40-47 (ESV)",
        scripture: [
            "Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd's pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine. And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance.",
            "And the Philistine said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?\" And David said to the Philistine, \"You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand... that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.\""
        ],
        reflection: [
            "So Saul tries to hook David up with his own armor—probably the best gear in Israel. David puts it on, tries to walk, and is like \"Yeah, I can't move in this.\" Takes it all off. Goes with what he knows: his sling and five smooth stones. That's IT. No sword. No spear. No armor. Just rocks.",
            "Goliath sees him coming and is straight-up insulted. \"Am I a dog that you come at me with sticks?\" He's basically laughing. This kid with rocks vs. a 9-foot giant with full battle gear? It's not even close. Except David's not relying on gear. Listen to what he says: \"You come with a sword and spear. I come in the name of the Lord.\" That's the difference. Goliath trusted his size and weapons. David trusted God.",
            "And then David says something that hits different: \"This isn't about me or you. This is so the whole earth knows there's a God in Israel.\" Wait—this isn't even about winning for David. It's about showing everyone watching that God is REAL. The whole army, both sides, everyone is about to see God move. And He does. David slings one stone, hits Goliath in the forehead, giant goes down. Game over.",
            "Here's the thing: David used what he had, not what he didn't have. He didn't try to be someone else. He was himself—a shepherd with a sling—and trusted God with the outcome. That's the move."

        questions: [
            "When have you tried to be someone you're not to fit in or succeed? How'd that go?",
            "What's your \"five smooth stones\"—the skills or tools God's already given you?",
            "David said this battle was about showing everyone God is real. If your life was a \"battle\" people were watching, what would they learn about God?",
            "What would it look like to step into your \"arena\" this week fully trusting God instead of your own gear?"

        context: "Context: David just killed Goliath. The Philistines flee. Israel celebrates. David becomes an instant legend. But fame comes with consequences.",
        scriptureRef: "1 Samuel 18:5-9 (ESV)",
        scripture: [
            "And David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him, so that Saul set him over the men of war. And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants. As they were coming home, when David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments.",
            "And the women sang to one another as they celebrated, \"Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands.\" And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, \"They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?\" And Saul eyed David from that day on."
        ],
        reflection: [
            "So David wins the battle, becomes a war hero, gets promoted. Everything's great, right? Wrong. The women start singing: \"Saul killed thousands, David killed TEN thousands.\" And just like that, King Saul goes from celebrating David to hating him. The dude who was just the shepherd kid nobody cared about is now the biggest threat to the king.",
            "This is wild. David didn't do anything wrong. He killed Goliath for GOD'S glory, remember? But now he's public enemy #1 just because people are comparing him to Saul. And from this point on, Saul literally tries to kill David multiple times. David goes from hero to hunted in like 24 hours.",
            "Here's what this teaches us: When you step out in faith and God does something big through you, not everyone's going to celebrate. Some people will feel threatened. Some will get jealous. Some will try to tear you down. It doesn't mean you did something wrong. It means you did something right and it made insecure people uncomfortable.",
            "David could've fought back. Could've tried to take the throne early. Could've become bitter. But he didn't. He kept trusting God's timing. Even when Saul was hunting him, David refused to hurt him because he knew God had a plan. That's maturity right there—staying humble and trusting God even when success brings enemies."
        ],
        questions: [
            "Ever had someone turn on you or get jealous when something good happened to you? How'd you handle it?",
            "Why do you think success or recognition can make people feel threatened instead of happy for you?",
            "David stayed humble and didn't retaliate against Saul. How do you stay grounded when you win or succeed at something?",
            "When have you been tempted to take revenge or get back at someone who wronged you? What stopped you (or what didn't)?"

        context: "Context: Fast forward. David becomes king eventually, just like God said. But it wasn't instant. He spent YEARS running from Saul, living in caves, being hunted. Yet he never gave up on God. Here's one of the psalms he wrote during that time.",
        scriptureRef: "Psalm 27:1-3 (ESV)",
        scripture: [
            "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When evildoers assail me to eat up my flesh, my adversaries and foes, it is they who stumble and fall. Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, yet I will be confident."
        ],
        reflection: [
            "This is David—the same kid who killed a giant with a rock—now as a grown man being chased through the desert, hiding in caves, living on the run. And this is what he writes: \"Whom shall I fear?\" Even with an entire ARMY coming after him, he says \"my heart shall not fear.\" That's not fake confidence. That's someone who's seen God show up so many times that fear doesn't control him anymore.",
            "Here's the arc of David's story: Overlooked shepherd → Giant killer → War hero → Hunted fugitive → King of Israel. It wasn't a straight line. There were years of waiting, hiding, and wondering if God forgot about him. But he never stopped trusting. And eventually, God's promise came true.",
            "So what's the giant killer mindset? It's this: God sees you even when others overlook you. God prepares you even in the boring/hard seasons. God fights for you when you step out in faith. And God's timing is always right, even when it feels slow. David's entire life was proof that when you trust God with your heart, He'll use you to do impossible things.",
            "The question is: Will you be like David? Will you stay faithful in the hidden seasons? Will you step up when everyone else backs down? Will you trust God's plan even when it doesn't make sense? Because if David—a forgotten shepherd kid—can become the greatest king in Israel's history, imagine what God can do with YOU."

            "David said \"Whom shall I fear?\" What would it take for YOU to live with that kind of confidence?",
            "Think about your life right now. Are you in a \"hidden season\" (preparing), a \"giant moment\" (facing something big), or an \"aftermath\" (dealing with consequences)? What does David's story teach you about your season?",
